finish the logger - store az, el

finish the main loop

make the tracking threaded

update the TLE data - check when was the file last updated (e.g. every day)

implement the motors library


add a task to track a satellite until it is manually stopped? (e.g. track continuously)

we could make a task be immediately executed by typing 'now'
e.g. When do you want to start calibrating? (YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss): now

map the id of the satellite to its name

find a way to transfer/write files wireless - we'll probably use shh

store the coordinates with a timestamp during the track in a string and then transfer it to a file

compute the trajectory on the paddock PC and send it (find_trajectory) *
update the tle data from the paddock (update_tle)
run the CLI on the paddock and update the que file on the rpi (groundstation_control, que)

group the files into folders

write a documentation

develop a testing plan
