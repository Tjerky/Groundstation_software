finish the logger - store az, el

finish the main loop

make the tracking threaded

update the TLE data - check when was the file last updated (e.g. every day)

implement the motors library


Questions?

should we add a task to track a satellite until it is manually stopped?

we could make a task be immediately executed by typing 'now'
e.g. When do you want to start calibrating? (YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss): now

map the id of the satellite to its name
